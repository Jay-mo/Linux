#How to install dhcp server on linux

module name - isc-dhcp-server(there are other packages out there that can also do the same thing. I chose to go with this. Another is dnsmasq)

apt-get install isc-dhcp-server


#configure /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
# here you give an interface that the dhcp server will be listening on to for DHCP requests

sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server

INTERFACESv4="eth0"


#configure /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
#this involves the creation of an actual subnet pool that the server will use to hand out addresses

subnet 192.168.128.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.128.100 192.168.128.150;
  option routers 192.168.128.1;
  option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
}

#enable isc-dhcp-server

sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server # this is to ensure that dhcp starts when the server reboots


#To fix issue with isc-server not starting on bootup with systemd
#it seems that isc-server is not recognised by system as a valid unit file or server.
#at this time my limited linux knowledge does not permit me to fully understand why. 
# But below is the required work around.

#configure /etc/systemd/system/isc-dhcp-server.service.d/retry.conf with the ff 

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/isc-dhcp-server.service.d/retry.conf

[Service]
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=15

Extras


#systemctl commands
#these commands will show you all the process that are running on your server
sudo systemctl status
sudo service --status-all


#How to check all installed packages
#to be sure that isc-server has been installed

apt list installed | grep isc
dpkg -l
dpkg-query -l


#How to list ports to see if dhcp server is listening on port 67
netstat -alnp | grep 67
